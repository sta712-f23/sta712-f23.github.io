## Recap: quasi-likelihood methods

## Recap: quasi-Poisson

## When to use quasi-Poisson models

* The response is a count variable
* The Poisson shape assumption looks good
* The response has more variability than a Poisson distribution accounts for
* We believe variance is a multiple of the mean

## Estimating the dispersion parameter

## Mean deviance estimate

## Pearson estimate

## Distribution of the estimates

## Inference with quasi-Poisson models

## Class activity
