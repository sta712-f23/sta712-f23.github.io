## Diagnostics and checking assumptions

1. Empirical log means / empirical logit / scatterplots. Apply any transformations needed
2. Fit the model
3. (Quantile) residual plots. Apply any transformations needed
4. VIFs and Cook's distance. Consider removing/modifying variables or observations
5. GOF tests (if applicable)

## What if assumptions are violated?

* Fix any shape violations first
* Then address distributional violations
  - Robust variance estimates
  - Use a different distribution/model for the response
  
## Recap: maximum likelihood asymptotics

## Maximum likelihood with mis-specified models
